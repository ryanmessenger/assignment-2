<h1>Welcome to my site, Please come and sit awhile.</h1>
<p>I started this website because Halloween has
	always been my favorite holiday. But during the last
	year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween
	products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse
	my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films.
	And if you join my email list, I will keep you
	up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>
